Monstrum Extended Settings Mod Readme:
Below you will find help for managing the mod as well as additional information about it.
The installation has gotten much simpler from version 6.0, so all that is required is step 1 from the installation instructions below.
However, an English video by the creator of the mod going through this readme is available here (outdated as it uses version 3.0, but can still be used): https://youtu.be/tR15sfybaDc
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation Instructions (Read very carefully):
1. Extract and move the contents of this folder to the root folder / directory of the Monstrum game on your computer. Replace any files when asked for confirmation. This is where the .exe file of the game is located. You can access this via Steam by clicking on the settings of the game and choosing "Browse local files".
Only step 1 is required for versions 6.0 and above. If the mod does not work after this, it is likely that you did not move the files correctly. The below steps are applicable if configuring the mod using Partiality.
2. Download "PartialityLauncher.zip" from https://github.com/DmitriySalnikov/PartialityLauncher/releases . You may have to click on the title of the latest version or on the Assets drop down menu if you do not see the file. Alternatively, you can download the older but official version of Partiality from https://github.com/PartialityModding/PartialityLauncher/releases . The older version is what is covered in the video tutorials, but the newer version has an interface that may be easier to use.
3. Extract Partiality to a memorable place on your computer.
4. If you are using the new Partiality, launch the executable file called "PartialityLauncher" inside the Partiality folder. If you are using the old Partiality, launch the batch file called "Partiality Launcher" inside the Partiality folder.
5. Press on "File" and "Open Game" in the top left corner of the window.
6. Navigate to Monstrum's root folder / directory and double click on the executable file called "Monstrum".
7. Tick the box for "MonstrumExtendedSettingsMod.dll".
8. Press "Apply Mods & Patches" [New] / "Apply Mods" [Old] at the bottom of the window and wait until the window "Mod results" appears.
An English video by the creator of the mod going through this readme is available here (outdated as it uses version 3.0, but can still be used): https://youtu.be/tR15sfybaDc
If you need additional help with the installation and usage of Partiality you can view a video by Partiality's creator on the process of using the old Partiality here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bOtCVR_DNw
Additionally, there is a video with German text specific to installing the mod available here (outdated as it uses version 2.0, but can still be used): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BIdnt0dPiw
IMPORTANT: If you used a previous standalone version of the mod (1.0, 1.1 or 1.2), you need to uninstall it before installing a newer Partiality version (2.0+). Furthermore, if you previously installed any of the 2.X versions (2.0, 2.1 or 2.2), then you must remove the old "Monstrum Extended Settings Mod.dll" file from the Mods folder or deselect it in Partiality. The mod will not work if you select both dll files in Partiality.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage Instructions:
-----
1-3 [In-game] Access the in-game mod settings menu available in the options. Hover over a setting to see its description and instructions on formatting.
-----
1-3 [Text]
1. Navigate your file explorer to the root folder / directory of the Monstrum game on your computer. As before, you can access this via Steam by clicking on the settings of the game and choosing "Browse local files".
2. Open the text file called "modSettings".
3. Read the instructions at the top and for each setting very carefully. The first line of each setting will tell you what the setting is and what its default value is, while any following lines are used by the game. Editing the default value shown does nothing.
-----
4. Change the settings to what you want.
5. Launch the game in one of the following ways:
- Steam;
- The executable file called "Monstrum" located in the game's root folder / directory;
- If using the new Partiality: The executable file called "PartialityLauncher" by pressing "Run Game" or by pressing "Apply Mods & Patches" at the bottom of the window and "Yes" in the prompt that appears once the process is completed;
- If using the old Partiality: The batch file called "Partiality Launcher Quick Launch" in the Partiality folder;
- If using the old Partiality: The batch file called "Partiality Launcher" by pressing "Apply Mods" at the bottom of the window and "Yes" in the prompt that appears once the process is completed.
6. If the mod is installed correctly and your settings are in the right format, the mod will show confirmation text on the loading screen after starting a new game.
IMPORTANT: A few settings will require a full restart of the game for proper performance, which are labelled appropriately in the "modSettings" file. Most settings typically only require you to start a new game via the in-game menu to update. If the game stops reading your settings correctly, download the mod again to get a clean settings file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How To Disable The Mod:
You can disable the mod in one of the following ways:
- Change the setting "Enable Mod" to false in the "modSettings" text file located in Monstrum's root folder / directory.
- Untick the box for "MonstrumExtendedSettingsMod" while running the Partiality Launcher (if downloaded) and press "Apply Mods & Patches" [New] / "Apply Mods" [Old] at the bottom of the window.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How To Uninstall The Mod (Only step 1 is necessary, but the other steps will remove any additional folders and files left behind):
1. Access the Steam settings for Monstrum and click "Verify integrity of game files" under Properties/Installed Files.
2. Remove the folders from the mod or those created by Partiality from Monstrum's root folder / directory. These are:
- "Challenges"
- "ModDependencies"
- "Mods"
- "PartialityHashes"
3. Delete the "Managed" folder inside of "Monstrum_Data". If it exists, rename "Managed_backup" in the same folder to "Managed". Else, repeat step 1.
4. Remove the files from the mod or those created by Partiality from Monstrum's root folder / directory. These are:
- "appid"
- "challengeCompletionTimes"
- "consoleLog"
- "exceptionLog"
- "modSettings"
5. Uninstall Partiality (if downloaded) by deleting the folder you created for it.
6. Delete the PartialityLauncher (if downloaded) and Monstrum Extended Settings Mod zip files you downloaded if not deleted already.
7. Close and delete this text file ("MESM Readme").
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General Information About The Mod And Other Notes:
This is a mod that allows you to customise additional settings that you are normally unable to.
If you use the mod in a video or stream, please link others to the mod in the description so that they know where to get it.
If you wish to talk more about the mod you can join Team Junkfish's Discord server (the creators of Monstrum) at http://discord.gg/Junkfish and talk about it in the channel #modding. This is also where in development versions are frequently posted.
Alternatively, you can join the Discord server dedicated to the mod at http://discord.com/invite/q5kSyd3. This server is not very active though and the Junkfish server is used more.
If your mod stops working after using it for a while and a new settings file (obtained either via download or by letting the game generate a new one after deleting the old one) does not fix the issue, or the game does not run normally again after uninstalling the mod and validating Monstrum's files, download a clean copy of the game via the Steam console. There is a guide on the console available here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=873543244
If you are still stuck after downloading a clean copy, try deleting all the files in "Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Team Junkfish\Monstrum" in the registry editor (regedit).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporting Bugs Or Getting Further Help:
Please contact the creator of the mod on Discord at Precipitator#5613 / precipitator.
You can do this either by adding them as a friend or by joining Team Junkfish's Discord server (the creators of Monstrum) at http://discord.gg/Junkfish and reporting the bug in the channel #modding. Of course the mod's dedicated server can also be used for this purpose.
It would aid in solving the issue to upload the "consoleLog", "exceptionLog" and "modSettings" text files when reporting a bug. You must rename or copy the logs after the bug occurs, as each time you start Monstrum again these files are reset.
IMPORTANT: Please do not contact any of the other people on the credits list for reporting bugs or getting help as they offered specialised assistance with development of the mod and do not know very much about its code in general.

Monstrum Extended Settings Mod V3.0 (Partiality) — 31.08.2021
-----
Added Settings:
* Monster Settings
- Force Many Monsters Mode
- Persistent Monster
- Seer Monster
- Brute Chase Speed Buff
- Fiend Door Teleportation

* Gamemode Settings
- Developed Multiplayer and Crew VS Monster modes to full functionality. There are still some additional features and bug fixes planned for future versions. Adding these into this version would have delayed its release even further and all the non-multiplayer features that have much fewer bugs.
> The modes are still local multiplayer, but external programs such as Parsec can be used to play local games with friends.
> Each monster has a unique ability that a monster player can use.
> The effects, active time and cooldown time of each ability can be customised.
> Split-screen or multiple displays may be used for the multiplayer. Multiple displays mode requires both displays to use the same resolution and the use multiple displays option to be enabled.
> A new audio system allows for the audio from all players to be played. This is performance heavy and may play audio incorrectly at times, so a setting has been included that switches the audio changes off. This will only play the audio for the first player, but will play everything as normal with no performance cost.
> The AI can be given control over the monster by the monster player or by default with a setting. This allows for the monster to be spectated without any player input.
