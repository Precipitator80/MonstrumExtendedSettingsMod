Difficulty|8
Description|It's complete darkness. You tried to use the liferaft, but it seems to be completely broken. Exhausted and out of breath, you feel a strange tingling sensation in the air as you scramble to fix one of the other escape routes. On top of that, your usual hiding spots seem to give you a shock when touched, making hiding in them impossible. Good luck!\nMade by rVuCL with edits by Precipitator.
